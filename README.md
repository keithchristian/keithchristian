**Education:**

-   B.A. Mathematics, Concordia University - Irvine, Ca.

-   EET (Electronics Technology), DeVry Tech - Atlanta, Ga.

**Overview:**

20+ years with Production Linux systems. Several years of expertise with Automation, PostgreSQL,
Mathematical/Statistical KPI log analysis, Custom Monitoring and Remediation, Fail2Ban, DDOS and
other anomaly detection.

**Comcast 2007 -- 2022 Senior Engineer, Engineering Operations**

*During my time at Comcast, I grew professionally by taking on more roles, updating my skillset by
writing and deploying two large software projects of approximately 3000 lines of TCL Expect code and
Shell scripts for automatically offloading data files to high-capacity storage and analytics
systems. I learned Git, docker container basics, the PostgreSQL relational database, and remediation
technology for system self-healing and/or ticket closure to save time in the middle tier customer
service area, and continuously sought ways to improve my efficiency and safety as a production
system administrator.*

-   Using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, I am developing a KPI gathering system for predictive analytics,
    host self-diagnosis, and enhanced messaging, to identify systems trending toward degraded
    states.

-   Developed statistical methods such as linear regression can predict approximate
    time-to-resource-exhaustion, and standard deviation and z-scores can identify similar KPI\'s to
    see outliers in system clusters and farms

-   Interesting alternate uses are detection of new devices and absent devices, and periodic
    connectivity verification of the host\'s connectivity to peer devices.

-   Developed processes to perform scheduled data transfers between systems, facilitate data
    conversion between MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, automate software installation, locate gaps
    in otherwise continuous data sequences, detect and block DDOS attacks at the host system,
    throttle data transfers to avoid network and CPU saturation, and similar use cases.

-   There were devices running Linux Kernels that were deployed locally to customers.

-   There were several devices that were running concurrently for thousands of customers.

-   Managed call-switching devices and software on Red Hat Linux servers deployed on HP DL-360
    bare-metal.

-   This was later moved to a private cloud running container based VMs

-   Container technology was leveraged to right-size the equivalent for the bare-metal install and
    tailored them to each application.

-   Container technology was Red Hat OpenShift.

-   Linux Server / Network Monitoring: Nagios, Expect, Ansible for monitoring and routine scripted
    maintenance tasks.

-   Linux DNS (BIND:) OS, BIND, Configuration and Zone files for multiple Red Hat DNS servers were
    standardized. Legacy issues with zone file transfers, missing zones, and miscellaneous access
    problems were cleaned up, resulting in several geographically redundant DNS servers.

-   Used DRBD and RSYNC on Red Hat Linux mail servers to provide High Availability / Geo Redundancy.

-   Network troubleshooting on Red Hat Linux systems utilized Ping, Traceroute, Nmap, Wireshark,
    Tcpdump.

-   Red Hat Linux based mailservers SMTP / POP3 (Sendmail, Qpopper, Dovecot, Surgemail:) Deployed
    several sets of Sendmail / POP3 mail storage clusters with the High Availability configuration
    described above.

-   Hardware: Familiar with HP, Dell, IBM, and Sun hardware.

**American Express - 2003-2007 - Linux Systems Admin / Systems Programmer**

-   Financial Systems Production Support: Lead Solaris / Red Hat Linux System Administrator.
    Provided 24x7 support for Financial applications on Windows / Solaris / Linux. Platforms were
    built upon Apache Tomcat, Java, Websphere MQ (MQSeries) or other standard frameworks.

-   Application Migration: Assisted in migrating approximately 100 applications to a remote data
    center.

-   Personnel Activities: Interviewed a Lead Project Manager, several Sybase DBA\'s, and a System
    Administrator.

**Agilent Technologies -- 2002 - 2003 - Linux Systems Admin / Systems Engineer, Web Programming**

-   Online Parts Catalog: eBusiness platform, Server side Javascript, Client side Javascript, HTML,
    CSS, Oracle on Solaris.

**XO Communications -- 2000 -- 2001 - Linux Systems Engineer / Web Programmer**

-   Website Programming: eBusiness, HPUX, Solaris, Oracle.

**Toshiba America Information Systems -- 1995 -- 2000 -- Linux Engineer, Web Programmer**

Website Programming: eBusiness and eSupport website. Solaris, Red Hat Linux, MS SQL Server.

-   OS Administration: Linux (Red Hat, Debian, CentOS) (24 years,) Solaris (5 years,) Windows (1
    year.)

    -   Install, configure, deploy applications on all three Red Hat, Debian, CentOS flavors.

-   Languages: Expect, TCL, Shell, Perl, standard Unix utilities.

-   Network: Ping, traceroute, nmap, wireshark, tcpdump.

-   SMTP / POP3 (Sendmail, Surgemail) Deployed High Availability Sendmail / Surgemail clusters.

-   DNS (BIND:) BIND, Configuration and Zone setup, geographically redundant DNS servers.

-   Container Technology: Docker (1 year.)

-   Web: HTML, CSS, Apache (2 years.)

**Classroom training:**

-   2014: Puppet Deployment

-   2012: Oracle Configuration and Database Administration.

-   2011: Red Hat Linux System Administration.
